  text: `# Carbon Scout Support Policy
  Version: v1

  ## Supported Standards & Frameworks
  - Carbon scout provides intelligence for scope 1, 2, 3 accounting compliant with POJK, ISO 14064, GHG Protocol, GRI, and EU CBAM standards.

  ## Carbon Market Benchmarks & Data Currency
  - Scout researches Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) benchmarks (biochar, direct air capture, cookstoves, forestry)
  - Only carbon credit price benchmarks from 2024-2026 are valid
  - Standard SLA report timeout is 20 seconds (20,000 ms)

  ## Required Disclaimers & Citation Rules
  - Every generated carbon report MUST contain mandatory disclaimer: "Prices reflect voluntary carbon market benchmarks and are subject to market volatility."
  - Every price quote or regulatory claim MUST include at least one valid HTTP/HTTPS source URL from an accredited carbon registry or public standard body.

  ## Abstention & Data Boundaries
  - Scout MUST NOT quote carbon credit prices or scope 3 disclosures for unlisted private entities or proprietary non-public corporate deals.
  - If public registry data is unavailable, scout MUST explicitly state that no public registry data exists rather than estimating or inventing figures.
